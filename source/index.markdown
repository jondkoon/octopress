I'm Jon Koon, a native Atlantan and now San Francisco based software developer with a focus in web development. I am passionate about creating highly responsive, usable, beautiful, well architected, and maintainable applications that solve real problems.

I have worked with major web frameworks in Ruby, Scala, Python, C#.NET, Java, and PHP. The common thread is HTTP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With an affinity for UI development and responsive applications I have been drawn to the study of JavaScript, front end architecture, and user experience design.

I'm foremost a follower of Christ, a Husband, and Father.  
My main gig is doing software development for [Twitter Inc.](http://twitter.com/) as a product engineer on the web team.
