I'm Jon Koon, an Atlanta based software developer with a focus in web development. I enjoy creating highly responsive, usable, beautiful, well architected, and maintainable applications that solve real problems.

I have worked with major web frameworks in Python, C#.NET, Java, and PHP. The common thread is HTTP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With an affinity for UI development and responsive applications I have been drawn to the study of JavaScript and front end architecture. I love working with jQuery and have developed a few plugins.

I'm foremost a follower of Christ, a Husband, and Father.  
I'm a part-time [Teacher](/teaching) and a lifelong Student.  
My main gig is doing Software Development with [The Proven Method's](http://provenmethod.com/professional-services) professional services team.
