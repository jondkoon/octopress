I'm Jon Koon, an Atlanta based software developer. A full stack web developer specifically. In my career I have worked with just about every web framework, language, database, and operating system in common use. I'm a jack of all backends, so for the last several years I have been attempting to master the front end. 

I love building highly responsive applications that are fun to use and do what you expect. I believe in Restful web services, client side templates, front end MVC architecture, PubSub, JavaScript, jQuery, and all things HTML5.

I'm foremost a follower of Christ, a husband, and father.  
I'm a part time teacher and a lifelong student.  
My main gig is doing Software Development with The Proven Method's professional services team.
