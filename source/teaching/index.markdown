I teach an Intro to Programming class at [The Creative Circus](http://creativecircus.edu) as a part of their Interactive Development program. The course covers variables, logic, control flow, iteration, functions, and object oriented programming using JavaScript. It is taught with web development in mind, but general programming best practices are emphasized.
