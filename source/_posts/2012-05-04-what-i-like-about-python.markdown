I have done several web projects in Python using [Django](http://djangoproject.com), but I never did a foundational study of the language before hand. So...  I am reading through [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/) and I wanted to document the things that I really like about Python as I am learning it from the ground up. 

Here is my list in no particular order

- multiline strings with `"""`
- dynamic typing
- imports
- simple format strings with `%`
- having a repl for easy experimentation
- pydoc
- [IPython](http://ipython.org/)
- The [Python Docs](http://docs.python.org/)
- unpacking arguments
- opening, reading, and writing files is very simple
- file writing and reading is designed so that scripts can run on multiple operating systems easily
- the `os` module is available for creating cross OS programs
- human readable ternary operator: `'yes' if exists(file) else 'no'`

I will also list a few gothchas or Aha moments:
- integer division
